## The Phoenix Project @ the University of Namur

The project seeks to renew our understanding of medieval parchments and antique coins. Artificial intelligence will be exploited to analyse data generated by materials characterization. This joint study will address questions about the production chain and the use of these objects and materials in past societies. Like the Phoenix which regenerates itself from age to age, we believe that the introduction of machine learning methods in heritage science will open a new age in this field.
